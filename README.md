# easysimplifiedvocabularytrainerphp

It is a vocabulary trainer written in php using pdo for database connection. Currently only one user account is supported. More will follow. It was written for private learning a time ago and now I want to open Source it. Note: This is an ongoing project and there will be improvements in future. It is still in alpha stadium and some variables and database tables will be renamed and changed. Check out in future!
Note: This program will use normal sql users and its permessions, so all users that can login in, can also login in phpmyadmin. For mysql table restrictions we use table permissions here.
